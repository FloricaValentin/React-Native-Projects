# React-Native-Projects

List of 3 simple and small  projects built with react native :

1 - TodoList 

2 - GamesReview App

3- Pokemon Cards

To run any of the project install dependencies (npm install ) and then run : npx expo start (Don't forget to select the app folder before you install dependencies and running the app ) 

I used expo and as for emulator I used Google Pixel 3a with API 35
